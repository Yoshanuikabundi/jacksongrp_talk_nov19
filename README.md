# jacksongrp_talk_nov19
Group given at the Jackson group meeting on November 8 2019 about computational chemistry

This talk was written with the HTML format in mind and is best viewed by downloading the whole repo and opening `myslides.html` in a browser. If you'd prefer another format, I recommend `notes.pdf`.
